# Loan-Approval-Prediction
The Loan Approval Prediction Project is a data-focused initiative that delves into the complex task of determining the likelihood of loan approval. It utilizes a diverse dataset containing multiple factors like applicant information, loan amount, credit history, and others. Through the application of various machine learning algorithms, the project aims to efficiently categorize loan applications.

### Prerequisites
1. Jupyter Notebook
2. Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost

### Algorithms
This project incorporates a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, each with its unique approach to the loan approval prediction task.
1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
3. Random Forest
4. Decision Tree
5. Neural Network(MLP)
